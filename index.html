        <h1>Emile Karam</h1>
        <h2>Business Developer @MEDIGO</h2>
        <p>
          Emile joined MEDIGO for a 6-month internship and quickly became a very valuable asset to our business development team. Emile is very analytical, learns fast, and is able to summarize complex findings into consolidated information. I was specifically impressed by his excellent work ethics, focus and ownership of his projects. He integrated with ease and charm into our diverse team and became a person who initiated very nice get togethers. I believe he will go far in his career and we will miss having him around at MEDIGO.
